# EAN-Elections

---

This project aims to develop a *Voting System* as an Android application using *Kotlin. The goal is to provide a secure and easy-to-use platform for both **voters* and *administrators*. The system will be divided into two main panels:

* *Voter Panel*: Allows users to log in, register, and cast their votes.
* *Admin Panel*: Allows administrators to manage elections, add candidates, view results, and manage voter data.

This project is ideal for organizations, communities, or small-scale elections that want to move their voting process to a mobile platform.

## Key Features (Expected)

* *Two Panels (Voters and Admins)*: Separate interfaces for voters and administrators to perform their respective functions.
* *Secure Voting*: Voters can log in securely, register, and cast their votes in a trusted environment.
* *Admin Capabilities*: Admins can manage elections, add candidates, view results, and track election statuses.
* *User-Friendly Interface: The app will have a simple and intuitive user interface built with **Kotlin* and modern Android UI components.
* *Firebase Integration* (Planned): Firebase will be used for authentication and data management (voter details, election data, results).

## Technologies

This Android Voting System will use the following technologies and tools:

* *Kotlin*: The main programming language for Android development.
* *Android Studio*: The IDE used for building the Android application.
* *Firebase* (Planned): For user authentication, database management, and storing election data.
* *Android SDK*: For developing the mobile app and integrating necessary Android components.

## Conclusion

The *Android Voting System* is an exciting project that aims to provide a reliable, secure, and efficient voting platform for elections, all from the convenience of a mobile app. With *Kotlin* as the primary language and *Firebase* for data management, this project promises to deliver an easy-to-use solution for both voters and administrators. We are currently in the early stages of development, and we welcome contributions to help bring this project to life!
